# Chapter 4.1 - Prerequisites

We're going to need a couple more things for this chapter than we did for the

- [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [`express-handlebars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
- [`morgan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
- [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
